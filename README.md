# geo-locator
main.py contains two functions: match_points and a helper function, calc_distance. match_points is the primary one, accepting two lists of geographic locations and returning a list which matches each point from the first list to its closest point from the second list. The format of both lists are as follows: each is a list of tuples, where the first element in each tuple is a longitude coordinate, and the second is a latitude coordinate. The return value is a list of indices, where each index i represents the index of the closest point from the second list to the current point. For example, if the returned list is [2, 4], then it means that the closest point to the first element of the first list is point 2 from the second list, and the closest point to the second element of the first list is point 4 from the second list.
calc_distance calculates the distance between two points, given their longitude and latitude coordinates. It does this using the haversine formula, taking into account the earth's curvature.
